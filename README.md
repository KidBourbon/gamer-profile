# Gamer Profile
Project of the course "Curso de Preprocesadores CSS" of the company Platzi. It's a web page with my gamer profile and with current news about video games. It was made with HTML and CSS. I used two preprocessors for better organization and code cleaning: Pug and Sass. And as compiler I used Prepros. The numbers that appear on the page are random :wink:
